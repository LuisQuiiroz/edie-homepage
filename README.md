Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?

  [Here](https://edie-homepage-q.netlify.app/)
  
- What was your experience?

  My experience was good, since I reused many components

- What have you learned/improved?

  I've learned that there are times when it's better to use Grid instead of Flex in order to achieve the layout you want.
  I added the responsive menu, since it was not in the design

- Your wisdom? :)

  Everything is possible with patience and creativity
